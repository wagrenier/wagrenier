# Hey there!

I'm William, I love old Japanese horror video games. My favorite are Fatal Frame 2 (Project Zero 2) and Rule of Rose. Preserving games and offering unique ways to play them to as many people as possible is a goal that inspires me and my work. My most well known work is the restoration of Fatal Frame 1 (Project Zero 1) where I restored the original Japanese 3D assets, inserted new English subtitles, restored all Japanese audio files, and created a simple tool to do all of that! My tool PssMux has already helped fix a few PS2 undubs üòÅ
